### Introduction
Halophilic archaea of the genus <em>Halobacterium</em> serve as the main genetic model system for Class Halobacteria in a general sense, significant genome data is available to gain insight into the broader levels of genomic diversity within the Class.  The halophilic archaea are therefore key systems for astrobiology-oriented studies of microbial radiation resistance, DNA-damage repair pathways, hypersaline physiology and long-term survival, and poly-extremophilic genetic adaptation. The knowledge gained from these studies provide important insights for understanding the potential for life in Mars- and space-like environments.  

In this project we have adapted bioinformatics workflows for comparative genomics and genome meta-analyses of Halobacteria species, as an integrated data-pipeline component for thematically-related halobacterial genomics research projects.  Our goals for this startup are to generate automated workflows and benchmarking datasets for basing allocation requests for a Research Proposal, including development of a Science Gateway.
