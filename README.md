### Introduction
Halophilic archaea of the genus <em>Halobacterium</em> serve as the main genetic model system for Class Halobacteria in a general sense, significant genome data is available to gain insight into the broader levels of genomic diversity within the Class.  The halophilic archaea are therefore key systems for astrobiology-oriented studies of microbial radiation resistance, DNA-damage repair pathways, hypersaline physiology and long-term survival, and poly-extremophilic genetic adaptation. The knowledge gained from these studies provide important insights for understanding the potential for life in Mars- and space-like environments.  

Our Co-PI for this project includes Dr. Linda Deveaux, who's laboratory in association with National Center for Genomic Resources (NGCR)(published, see citations), generated sample genome sequences which they provided as demonstration data for this application.  The Deveaux Lab data represents separate cultures from an artificial selection experiment in which parallel <em>Halobacterium</em> cultures were treated with high-dosage ionizing radiation over serial treatments, and the genome from each culture sequenced with PacBio.  Dr. Deveaux's genetics experiments have identified the conserved DNA-repair gene RPA as being upregulated in response to DNA damage; these experiments can further elucidate differential mutational profiles associated with the RPA pathway.

Collaborator Dr. Jill Mikucki is a microbial ecologist specializing

## Methodology
### A. <em>Halobacterium salinarium</em> functional genomics meta-analysis
In this repository we present a set of automated bioinformatics workflows for comparative genomics and genome meta-analyses of Haloarchaeal genomics data.  In this application section, sample data is focused on the species <em>Halobacterium salinarium</em>, which has various published experimental genomics datasets and strain-level reference genomes, plus RNA-seq and ChIP-seq datasets accessible in automated manner via the NCBI E-Direct API.


 
### B. Meta-genomics, diversity and phylogenetics analysis for environmental isolates from hypersaline microbial habitats
